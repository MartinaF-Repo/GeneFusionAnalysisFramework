## Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end pipeline for the analysis of gene fusion events, which are structural DNA rearrangements known to play a key role in cancer development.

The pipeline covers the full workflow from raw fusion data to functional interpretation and oncogenicity assessment. Its main components include:

- Initial data cleaning and preprocessing for downstream analysis
- Sequence mapping from transcripts to genomic DNA to assess retained and lost regions
- Retrieval of key protein domains using both a standard annotation tool and a novel proposed method
- Expression analysis based on Arriba gene fusion detection outputs
- Functional impact assessment through the generation of biologically informed flags
- Gene fusion categorization based on structural, functional, and expression features
- Oncogenicity prediction using a PU-graph model (positive–unlabeled graph learning), adopted due to the absence of reliable negative ground-truth labels
